########### is.pconsecutive ##############
# little helper function to determine if the time periods of an object are consecutive per id.
# By consecutive we mean "consecutive in the numbers", i.e., is.pconsecutive takes the numerical
# value of the time variable into account: t, t+1, t+2, ... where t is an integer
#
# For this, we need as.numeric(as.character(time_var)) where as.character is a crucial part!
# Equivalent but more efficient is as.numeric(levels(id_timevar))[as.integer(id_timevar)]
# (see R FAQ 7.10 for coercing factors to numeric]
# and the coercion of time_var in this manner needs to be meaningful numbers.
#
# see also in separate file make.pconsecutive.R:
#   * make.pconsecutive
#   * make.pbalanced


#' Check if time periods are consecutive
#' 
#' This function checks for each individual if its associated time periods are
#' consecutive (no "gaps" in time dimension per individual)
#' 
#' (p)data.frame, pseries and estimated panelmodel objects can be tested if
#' their time periods are consecutive per individual.  For evaluation of
#' consecutiveness, the time dimension is interpreted to be numeric, and the
#' data are tested for being a regularly spaced sequence with distance 1
#' between the time periods for each individual (for each individual the time
#' dimension can be interpreted as sequence t, t+1, t+2, \ldots{} where t is an
#' integer). As such, the "numerical content" of the time index variable is
#' considered for consecutiveness, not the "physical position" of the various
#' observations for an individuals in the (p)data.frame/pseries (it is not
#' about "neighbouring" rows). If the object to be evaluated is a pseries or a
#' pdata.frame, the time index is coerced from factor via as.character to
#' numeric, i.e., the series
#' `as.numeric(as.character(index(<pseries/pdata.frame>)[[2]]))]` is
#' evaluated for gaps.
#' 
#' The default method also works for argument `x` being an arbitrary
#' vector (see **Examples**), provided one can supply arguments `id`
#' and `time`, which need to ordered as stacked time series. As only
#' `id` and `time` are really necessary for the default method to
#' evaluate the consecutiveness, `x = NULL` is also possible. However, if
#' the vector `x` is also supplied, additional input checking for equality
#' of the lengths of `x`, `id` and `time` is performed, which is
#' safer.
#' 
#' For the data.frame interface, the data is ordered in the appropriate way
#' (stacked time series) before the consecutiveness is evaluated. For the
#' pdata.frame and pseries interface, ordering is not performed because both
#' data types are already ordered in the appropriate way when created.
#' 
#' Note: Only the presence of the time period itself in the object is tested,
#' not if there are any other variables.  `NA` values in individual index
#' are not examined but silently dropped - In this case, it is not clear which
#' individual is meant by id value `NA`, thus no statement about
#' consecutiveness of time periods for those "`NA`-individuals" is
#' possible.

#' @name is.pconsecutive
#' @aliases is.pconsecutive
#' @param x usually, an object of class `pdata.frame`,
#'     `data.frame`, `pseries`, or an estimated
#'     `panelmodel`; for the default method `x` can also be
#'     an arbitrary vector or `NULL`, see **Details**,
#' @param na.rm.tindex logical indicating whether any `NA` values
#'     in the time index are removed before consecutiveness is
#'     evaluated (defaults to `FALSE`),
#' @param index only relevant for `data.frame` interface; if
#'     `NULL`, the first two columns of the data.frame are
#'     assumed to be the index variables; if not `NULL`, both
#'     dimensions ('individual', 'time') need to be specified by
#'     `index` for `is.pconsecutive` on data frames, for
#'     further details see [pdata.frame()],
#' @param id,time only relevant for default method: vectors specifying
#'     the id and time dimensions, i. e., a sequence of individual and
#'     time identifiers, each as stacked time series,
#' @param \dots further arguments.
#' @return A named `logical` vector (names are those of the
#'     individuals). The i-th element of the returned vector
#'     corresponds to the i-th individual. The values of the i-th
#'     element can be: \item{TRUE}{if the i-th individual has
#'     consecutive time periods,} \item{FALSE}{if the i-th
#'     individual has non-consecutive time periods,}
#'     \item{"NA"}{if there are any NA values in time index of
#'     the i-th the individual; see also argument `na.rm.tindex`
