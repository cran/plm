                  pooled estimators. The estimators included the OLS,

                  feasible GLS estimators. Even allowing for a
                  ten-year distributed lag on price to reflect changes
                  in auto-efficiency characteristics, the
                  within-country estimator yields appreciably more
                  inelastic estimates than did the O:S estimator,
                  which was heavily influenced by the between- or

                  in an application to life-cycle labor supply under
                  uncertainty. The estimators studied are two-stage
                  least squares, generalized method-of-moments (GMM),
                  forward filter, independently weighted GMM, and
                  split-sample instrumental variables. I compare the
                  bias/efficiency trade-off for the estimators using
                  bootstrap algorithms suggested by Freedman and by
                  Brown and Newey. Results indicate that the downward
                  bias in GMM is quite severe as the number of moment
                  conditions expands, outweighing the gains in
                  efficiency. The forward-filter estimator, however,
                  has lower bias and is more efficient than two-stage

abstract = {SUMMARY In the fixed-effects stochastic frontier model an
                  efficiency measure relative to the best firm in the
                  sample is universally employed. This paper considers
                  a new measure relative to the worst firm in the
                  sample. We find that estimates of this measure have
                  smaller bias than those of the traditional measure
                  when the sample consists of many firms near the
                  efficient frontier. Moreover, a two-sided measure
                  relative to both the best and the worst firms is
                  proposed. Simulations suggest that the new measures
                  may be preferred depending on the skewness of the
                  inefficiency distribution and the scale of
                  efficiency differences. Copyright 2010 John Wiley \&

                  (1980) LM test for cross-equation correlation in a
                  SUR model is not appropriate for testing
                  cross-sectional dependence in panel data models when
                  the number of cross-sectional units (n) is large and
                  the number of time periods (T) is small. In fact, a
                  scaled version of this LM test was proposed by
                  Pesaran (2004) and its finite sample bias was

                  this scaled version of the LM test in the context of
                  a fixed effects homogeneous panel data model. This

 abstract = {There occurs on some occasions a difficulty in deciding
                  the direction of causality between two related
                  variables and also whether or not feedback is
                  occurring. Testable definitions of causality and
                  feedback are proposed and illustrated by use of
                  simple two-variable models. The important problem of
                  apparent instantaneous causality is discussed and it
                  is suggested that the problem often arises due to
                  slowness in recording information or because a
                  sufficiently wide class of possible causal variables
                  has not been used. It can be shown that the cross

                  into two parts, each relating to a single causal arm

                  distribution of d are investigated and the exact
                  distribution is compared with six approximations to
                  it for four sets of published data. It is found that
                  approximations suggested by Theil and Nagar and by
                  Hannan are too inaccurate for practical use but that
                  the beta approximation proposed in the 1950 and 1951

abstract = "This paper develops unit root tests for panel data. These
                  tests are devised under more general assumptions
                  than the tests previously proposed. First, the
                  number of groups in the panel data is assumed to be
                  either finite or infinite. Second, each group is
                  assumed to have different types of nonstochastic and
                  stochastic components. Third, the time series spans
                  for the groups are assumed to be all
                  different. Fourth, the alternative where some groups
                  have a unit root and others do not can be dealt with
                  by the tests. The tests can also be used for the
                  null of stationarity and for cointegration, once
                  relevant changes are made in the model, hypotheses,
                  assumptions and underlying tests. The main idea for
                  our unit root tests is to combine p-values from a
                  unit root test applied to each group in the panel
                  data. Combining p-values to formulate tests is a
                  common practice in meta-analysis. This paper also
                  reports the finite sample performance of our
                  combination unit root tests and Im et al.'s [Mimeo
                  (1995)] t-bar test. The results show that most of
                  the combination tests are more powerful than the
                  t-bar test in finite samples. Application of the
                  combination unit root tests to the post-Bretton
                  Woods US real exchange rate data provides some
                  evidence in favor of the PPP hypothesis."
