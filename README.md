## About

`plm` is a package for panel data econometrics for the **R** statistical computing
environment. The package includes functions for model estimation, testing, robust 
covariance matrix estimation, panel data manipulation and information. It was 
first published on **CRAN** in 2006.
 
Be sure to read the NEWS on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=plm) (or
in the [development repository](https://github.com/ycroissant/plm/blob/main/NEWS.md))
for any changes in new releases (new features, bugfixes, other improvements, ...).

Non-exhaustive function overview: 

- Functions to estimate models:
  - `plm`: panel data estimators (within/fixed effects, random effects, between,
           first-difference, nested random effects), incl. instrumental-variable 
           estimation techniques (IV) and Hausman-Taylor-style models,
  - `pgmm`: generalized method of moments (GMM) estimation for panel data,
  - `pggls`: estimation of general feasible generalized least squares models,
  - `pmg`: mean groups (MG), demeaned MG and common correlated effects (CCEMG) estimators,
  - `pcce`: estimators for common correlated effects mean groups (CCEMG) and pooled (CCEP) for panel data with common factors,
  - `pvcm`: variable coefficients models,
  - `pldv`: panel estimators for limited dependent variables.

- Testing functions:
  - model specification (`phtest`, `pFtest`, `pooltest`, `plmtest`, `pwaldtest`, `piest`, `aneweytest`, `mtest`, `sargan`),
  - serial correlation (`pbgtest`, `pwfdtest`, `pbnftest`, `pdwtest`, `pwartest`, `pbsytest`, `pbltest`), 
  - cross-sectional dependence (`pcdtest`),
  - panel unit root (`purtest`, `cipstest`, `phansitest`),
  - panel Granger (non-)causality (`pgrangertest`).
  
- Robust covariance matrix estimators (incl. various weighting schemes
  for small sample adjustment):
  - `vcovHC`: Arellano (1987), White (1980),
  - `vcovBK`: Beck and Katz (1995) (PCSE),
  - `vcovNW`: Newey and West (1987),
  - `vcovDC`: double-clustering robust (Thompson (2011), Cameron et al. (2011)),
  - `vcovSCC`: Driscoll and Kraay (1998).

- An enhanced data frame, called `pdata.frame`, to deal with data sets for which 
  observations are identified by a combination of two indexes.

- Panel data transformation functions (e.g., `Within`, `Between`, `between`, `lag`, 
  `lead`, `diff`).

- Other functions relating to panel data sets, e.g.:
  - checks for panel data dimensions (individual, time, group) and balancedness (`pdim`), 
  - checks for panel balancedness (`is.pbalanced`) and consecutiveness (regularity) (`is.pconsecutive`) 
    as well as functions to change data to conform to these properties 
    (`make.pbalanced`, `make.pconsecutive`),
  - measures for unbalancedness of data (`punbalancedness`) (Ahrens/Pincus (1981)).

## Documentation

Package plm comes with documentation: Besides the usual help pages for each function,
the vignettes provide a gentle introduction to the package and some functions.
Vignettes are available at the package's CRAN website <https://cran.r-project.org/package=plm>
and can be browsed from within R by `browseVignettes("plm")`.

New package users are advised to start with the first vignette 
*Panel data econometrics in R: the plm package* for an overview of the package. 
A more in-depth treatment of estimation of error component models and instrument
variable models is in the second vignette *Estimation of error component models 
with the plm function*.
